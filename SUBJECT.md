cub3D
My first RayCaster with miniLibX
Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which is
considered the first FPS ever created. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal
will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, where you will have to find your way.

Chapter I
Foreword
Developed by Id Software, led by the world-renowned John Carmack and John Romero,
and published in 1992 by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the history of video games.
Figure I.1: John Romero (left) and John Carmack (right) posing for posterity.
Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II
(Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996) and Quake (Id Software, 1996),
that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.
Now, it’s your turn to relive History...

The game Wolfenstein 3D originally takes place in the Nazi Germany,
which could be potentially disturbing. Pictures and history of
this game are only brought to you for technical reasons and pop/geek
culture reasons, as the game was considered as a masterpiece for
both.

Goals
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: rigor, use of C, basic
algorithms, information research, etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
In conclusion, cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of numerous documents available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
If this suits you, you can test the original game before starting this project:

Common Instructions
• Your project must be written in C.
• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check, and you will receive a 0 if
there is a norm error.
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.) except for undefined behavior. If this occurs, your project will be
considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed when necessary. Memory leaks
will not be tolerated.
• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile that compiles your source
files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.
Additionally, your Makefile must not perform unnecessary relinking.
• Your Makefile must contain at least the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.
• To submit bonuses for your project, you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless
the subject specifies otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is
conducted separately.
• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile into a libft folder. Your project’s Makefile must compile
the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work
does not need to be submitted and will not be graded. It will give you an
opportunity to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find these tests
especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use
your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
• Submit your work to the assigned Git repository. Only the work in the Git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will occur

after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

Chapter IV
AI Instructions
● Context
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the time to
explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your work. However, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether it’s
code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely sure
that your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peers
are a valuable resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.
● Main message
☛ Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
☛ Develop prompting skills — both coding and non-coding — that will benefit your
future career.
☛ Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases,
and ethical issues.
☛ Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
☛ Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility
for.
● Learner rules:
• You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so
you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
• You should reflect on your problem before prompting — this helps you write clearer,
more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
• You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning,
and testing anything generated by AI.
• You should always seek peer review — don’t rely solely on your own validation.
7
cub3D My first RayCaster with miniLibX
● Phase outcomes:
• Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
• Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
• Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and
collaboration.
● Comments and examples:
• You’ll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — where
you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your
technical and interpersonal skills.
• Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your understanding. Make peer learning a priority.
• AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. Your
peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
• Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alternative perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.
✓ Good practice:
I ask AI: “How do I test a sorting function?” It gives me a few ideas. I try them out
and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.
✗ Bad practice:
I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peerevaluation, I can’t explain what it does or why. I lose credibility — and I fail my
project.
✓ Good practice:
I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch
two bugs and rewrite it together — better, cleaner, and fully understood.
✗ Bad practice:
I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can’t
explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my
project.

Mandatory part - cub3D
Program name cub3D
Turn in files All your files
Makefile all, clean, fclean, re, bonus
Arguments a map in format *.cub
External functs.
• open, close, read, write,
printf, malloc, free, perror,
strerror, exit, gettimeofday.

Libft authorized Yes
Description You must create a “realistic” 3D graphical
representation of the inside of a maze from a
first-person perspective. You have to create this
representation using the ray-casting principles
mentioned earlier.
The constraints are as follows:
• You must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating
system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will
need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common
Instructions part.
• The management of your window must remain smooth: changing to another window, minimizing, etc.
9
cub3D My first RayCaster with miniLibX
• Display different wall textures (the choice is yours) that vary depending on which
side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).
10
cub3D My first RayCaster with miniLibX
• Your program must be able to set the floor and ceiling colors to two different ones.
• The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:
◦ The left and right arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and
right in the maze.
◦ The W, A, S, and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through
the maze.
◦ Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
◦ Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.
◦ The use of images of the minilibX library is strongly recommended.
• Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .cub
extension.
◦ The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the player’s start position and spawning
orientation.
This is a simple valid map:
111111
100101
101001
1100N1
111111
◦ The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return
an error.
◦ Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or
more empty lines.
◦ Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of
element can be set in any order in the file.
◦ Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
by one or more spaces.
◦ The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map,
as long as it respects the rules of the map.
11
cub3D My first RayCaster with miniLibX
◦ Except for the map, each element must begin with its type identifier (composed
by one or two characters), followed by its specific information in a strict order:
∗ North texture:
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
· identifier: NO
· path to the north texture
∗ South texture:
SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
· identifier: SO
· path to the south texture
∗ West texture:
WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
· identifier: WE
· path to the west texture
∗ East texture:
EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
· identifier: EA
· path to the east texture
∗ Floor color:
F 220,100,0
· identifier: F
· R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255

◦ If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program
must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message
of your choice.

Chapter VI
Bonus part
Bonuses will be evaluated only if your mandatory part is perfect.
By perfect we naturally mean that it needs to be complete, that it
cannot fail, even in cases of nasty mistakes such as incorrect usage,
etc. It means that if your mandatory part does not obtain ALL the
points during the grading, your bonuses will be entirely IGNORED.
Bonus list:
• Wall collisions.
• A minimap system.
• Doors which can open and close.
• Animated sprites.
• Rotate the point of view with the mouse.
You will be able to create better games later do not waste too much
time!
You are allowed to use other functions or add symbols on the map to
complete the bonus part as long as their use is justified during your
evaluation. You are also allowed to modify the expected scene file
format to fit your needs. Be smart!

Chapter VIII
Submission and peer-evaluation
Submit your assignment to your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the names of
your files to ensure they are correct.
During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested. This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or
rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
While this step may not be applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it
if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines.
This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g.,
your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes — unless a specific
timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation.
You can, for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a
display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc.
The details (scope, target, etc.) will be specified in the evaluation guidelines and may
vary from one evaluation to another for the same project.
